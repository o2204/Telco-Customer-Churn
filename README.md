# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction Project
## 💡 A Machine Learning Classification Project

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This dataset represents customer information, where each row corresponds to a customer and each column contains attributes described in the column metadata. The dataset includes the following key information:

- **Churn Status:** Indicates whether the customer left within the last month (column: Churn).
- **Services:** The services each customer has subscribed to, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
- **Customer Account Information:** Includes the duration of the customer relationship, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
- **Demographic Information:** Includes customer gender, age range, and details about whether they have partners and dependents.
