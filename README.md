📉 Customer Churn Prediction Project
💡 A Machine Learning Classification Project
📁 Project Overview

This dataset represents customer information, where each row corresponds to a customer and each column contains attributes described in the column metadata. The dataset includes the following key information:

Churn Status: Indicates whether the customer left within the last month (column: Churn).

Services: The services each customer has subscribed to, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.

Customer Account Information: Includes the duration of the customer relationship, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.

Demographic Information: Includes customer gender, age range, and details about whether they have partners and dependents.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Flask (for deployment)

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA & visualization)

📈 Model Development
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, one-hot encoding and feature scaling.

Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Hyperparameter tuning used GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.


📊 Visualizations:

Confusion matrix to evaluate the model’s performance.
